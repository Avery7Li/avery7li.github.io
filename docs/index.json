While a certain number of sensors are known to individual City divisions, there is no centralized source of information on the types of sensors that exist in the City and what information is being collected and stored. In accordance with their Digital Infrastructure Strategic Framework (DISF), the City of Toronto aims to enhance transparency when it comes to where and how sensors are used throughout the city‚Äôs public realm.\nMy capstone project brought together a diverse team from engineering, computer science, international relations, and information sciences. Our team aimed to design a public registry that catalogues and classifies these sensors. To meet the objective, the registry needs to comprehensively describe City-owned sensors installed across Toronto and present this information in a clear and accessible way to all potential registry users.\n Research and Methods The team conducted a jurisdictional scan to capture best practices from other municipalities with online sensor, open data, and IoT device registries. A policy and legislation review was carried out to inform relevant attributes to describe each sensor from legal, governmental, and policy perspectives, such as the privacy impact assessment score. We also researched ontology and formal knowledge representation to design the structure and meaning of relevant sensor attributes based on industry standards. In addition, a diverse set of perspectives were obtained from stakeholder surveys.\nWe designed an initial prototype using wireframing software, Figma. Multiple prototyping iterations and usability testing phases were conducted to yield the final design.\nMy Contribution As a member studying computer science in this diverse team, I contributed to the technical part of the project. Using the leaflet library on R, I created the interactive map with the sensors with randomized attributes added as markers onto the map and carried out iterations of prototype testing. By doing a literature review on ontology, I proposed a fraction of the attributes to be included on the registry. With prior experience with web development and knowledge of JavaScript and map visualization, I provided recommendations on the technical implementation of the registry front-end and data back-end. In addition, by researching the data dissemination mechanism, we proposed a marketing plan for informing citizens of the registry.\n  Results The final design represents sensors in an interactive map with a filtering mechanism and provides more detailed information about each sensor in a table. The figures below show part of the prototype and the list of sensor attributes. Additional features include a privacy impact assessment score and an API for dataset requests to accommodate a diverse range of user needs and public interests.\n Figure 1: Prototype Screenshot   Figure 2: Selected Sensor Attributes  Evaluation With 16 prototype tests, the team applied several critical design changes to ensure any sensor information of interest is accessible, comprehensive, and meaningful.\n Impact By designing a robust, detailed, and consistent registry of remote sensors in Toronto‚Äôs public realm, we will have enabled greater dissemination of information to Toronto‚Äôs general public. In doing so, the registry will permit the public to identify and understand what types of sensors exist in the places and be able to access available datasets and technical information.\n  Growth In the beginning, I was drawn to this project as I had worked with many preprocessed datasets but was unfamiliar with the data collection process. With acknowledgement of the importance of ethics in data science, I was interested in data privacy and wanted to explore how information transparency and public trust could be improved by the creation of a public registry.\nBy the end of this project, I‚Äôve found my answer to the above questions. Further, I encountered unforeseen challenges and learned more from my teammates, the supervisor, and the clients. Unlike my previous computer science projects, this project did not involve a large amount of coding but was even more challenging for me. Coming from an arts and science background, I initially struggled to understand engineering requirements. With the help of teammates in engineering, I was able to gradually catch up with the setting and combine ideas from science and engineering to propose practical solutions to the problems.\nBesides challenges on the technical skills, this project provided me with a great opportunity of developing critical soft skills such as communication and teamwork skills. Working with team members from different fields puts a high demand on communication skills. I practiced explaining specific terminologies and conveying my ideas clearly in an easily understandable way.

By analyzing how different factors affected the pattern, recommendations were made to help with urban space design decisions.\nMethods The analysis was carried out using Python on Jupyter Notebook. The results are presented in visualization such as charts and heatmap plots with interactive widgets. We also created a dashboard using Voila, which turns Jupyter notebooks into standalone web applications. The dashboard enabled us to better communicate the results to the audience.\nTo answer the question of how people are making using the space in Sidewalk Lab and where they tend to linger, we divided each space evenly into 12 square blocks with 3 rows and 4 columns so that each block occupies approximately the same area. The behavior zones were generated using createBehaviorZone from the Numina API. For each of the streetscape, under the raincoat, and outside areas, we queried the data for the average dwell time in each of the 12 subareas using zoneDwellTimeDistribution during the period when the Sidewalk Lab is open to the public from February 20, 2019, to January 12, 2020. Then, we displayed the overall average dwell time on the heatmap, where darker blue in a square indicates a longer dwell time in that block. Radio buttons were used to select an area among the three to see the corresponding heatmap of dwell times. The users could use the dropdown menu to pick one of the events to view how events affect dwell times and the position where people linger.\nThen, we analyzed the desire lines, which are the travelling lines of the visitors, to learn where people tend to pass through. Heatmap drawn in the webpage utilized the data feedHeatmps in the GraphQL database. A scatter plot was drawn by the value and its x, y coordinate generated by the feedHeatmaps query. The scatter plot located the point by its coordinate, reflecting the value using the deepness of a predefined colour scheme. The image of the sandbox was selected by the input of the user and scaled to the right ratio to accurately display the plots. A calendar that summarizes the population of a site by day was generated along with the heatmap. On the calendar figure, the deepness of the colour reflects the average value among all coordinates. The average value was calculated once per day in the given time span.\n Results The calendar heatmap gave us an overall idea of the daily dwell time pattern although it could not be used to compare the dwell time among the three areas. In May, people spent a long time under the raincoat largely because of the rainy season. On the other hand, people lingered outside in June and July, when the weather was nice in summer.\n Figure 1: Calendar heatmap of dwell time   Figure 2: Dwell time at events in 12 subareas  In terms of the travelling lines of the visitors, we could tell from the figure that there had been tables in the middle area under the raincoat. On some occasions, people did not tend to pass through two circular areas in the middle of the streetscape.\n Figure 3: Desire lines at streetscape  Recommendations were made for when maintenance operations could be possible scheduled based on our observations. In general, the three areas should be maintained separately on different weekdays if possible. The best time for maintenance during the daytime would be in the morning. The streetscape should be maintained mostly frequently with an average of once every two days. In addition, we recommended the operators maintain the place before and after each event.\n Figure 4: Site visit counts   Growth Through this project, I had the opportunity to gain firsthand experience of a data scientist‚Äôs workflow, including the cleaning, wrangling, analysis, and visualization of data. In addition, I practiced using API to remotely obtain data used on the webpage without loading the data to any local machine, which could impose a security threat. I gained the understanding that it is important to be careful and serious about the privacy philosophy.\n ","date":1586476800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1586476800,"objectID":"286ba7682b0cc553facaca7d518c2a2a","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/project/space-usage-analysis/","publishdate":"2020-04-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/space-usage-analysis/","section":"project","summary":"Data analysis on space usage with Sidewalk Lab","tags":["data analysis"],"title":"Understanding Space Usage","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

The competition looked for innovative ideas on disaster relief issues. We were tackling the inefficient relief supply distribution, a problem caused by the lack of transparent information and trust. When a natural disaster happens, information acquisition between two parties that need and provide resources rely on traditional media. There are often information barriers between each other that lack a resource scheduling scheme.\nMethods To ensure mutual trust, blockchain was used in our solution as it has a transparent mechanism. Blockchain technology has the benefits of increased transparency in data shared on the network, contributing to enhanced trust among different organizations. During the development process, I used the Go language to implement chaincode, a ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù that handled the demand and supply matching logic under the Hyperledger Fabric framework.\nBased on blockchain, we built functions such as information release and evaluation systems. In addition, we formed the scheme of a matchmaking system to match the disaster-stricken party with the relief provider. The design also included a feedback mechanism for the participant organizations, and the results would affect the supply distribution priority of the next matchmaking.\n Results Through the development and research of the Global Aim Match System, the team formed a systematic disaster relief chain solution that would increase transparency and boost the efficiency of disaster assistance. Our project placed among the top five in the Greater China region.\nCheck the GitHub repo here\nCall for Code 2019 Global Challenge\n ","date":1562198400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562198400,"objectID":"1bf7c91eb2c18285a73b242c1182df2c","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/project/global-aid-match-system/","publishdate":"2019-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/global-aid-match-system/","section":"project","summary":"IBM Call for Code 2019 Global Challenge","tags":["software"],"title":"Global Aid Match System","type":"project"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.

In terms of the design, there are two classes important for the individual games. The first class is the board manager, which controls the behaviour of the boards. The second class is the movement controller that controls the behaviour of the grid views. The movement controller composites a board manager so that it supervises the manager according to the user‚Äôs interaction, such as tapping and swiping, to the grid views.\nThe game center has three core fragments, which are the profile fragment, the scoreboard fragment, and the games fragment respectively. The profile and scoreboard fragments store and display user information corresponding to data on the Firebase database.\nThe main design pattern used in the game center implementation is the Model-View-Controller pattern, where the model classes contain the data, view classes present the data and controller classes modify the data. With this design, the testing was convenient as only the controller (logic) classes need to be tested.\n Results The platform contains registration, login, and scoreboard features, which allow the players to form communities, play new games, and compete in a ranking system. The sample games provided on the platform include Sudoku, 2048, and Sliding Tiles. The figures below show the game center preview.\n Figure 1: Login Page   Figure 2: Game Screenshots   Growth Through this project, I learned and practiced object-oriented programming using Java. In addition, the Mars platform was my first large project in a team environment. The time our team spent working together at Bahen center was one of the best memories of my undergraduate. I learned from this experience that teamwork is much more than five individuals working in parallel like threads. Creative solutions often come from team interactions.\nCheck the GitHub repo here\n ","date":1544400000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544400000,"objectID":"88f9fd47c1eefc026af6f51dcb3fddcb","permalink":"https://academic-demo.netlify.app/project/mars-platform/","publishdate":"2018-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mars-platform/","section":"project","summary":"An Android Mini-Game Platform","tags":["software development"],"title":"Mars Game Center","type":"project"},{"authors":["admin","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
